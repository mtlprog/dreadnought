# What is Panarchy?

Panarchy is a conceptual framework for understanding how complex adaptive systems evolve across multiple scales of space and time.

## Definition

**Panarchy** describes how economic growth and human development depend on ecosystems and institutions that are subject to cycles of change at multiple scales.

The term was coined by C.S. Holling and colleagues to describe the hierarchical structure of adaptive cycles operating at different scales.

## Core Principles

### 1. Multiple Scales

Systems operate at different scales:
- **Micro** - Individual and household level
- **Meso** - Community and organizational level
- **Macro** - Regional and national level

### 2. Adaptive Cycles

Each scale experiences its own adaptive cycle with four phases:
- **Growth (r)** - rapid growth and exploitation
- **Conservation (K)** - consolidation and stability
- **Release (Ω)** - creative destruction
- **Reorganization (α)** - renewal and innovation

### 3. Cross-Scale Interactions

Systems at different scales interact through:
- **Revolt** - rapid change from smaller to larger scales
- **Remember** - legacy and memory from larger to smaller scales

## Why Panarchy Matters

Understanding panarchy helps us:

1. **Design resilient systems** that can adapt to change
2. **Navigate transitions** during periods of disruption
3. **Build adaptive capacity** across multiple scales
4. **Recognize opportunities** for transformation

## Key Takeaways

- Panarchy is about understanding **nested adaptive cycles**
- Systems operate at **multiple scales simultaneously**
- Change cascades both **upward** (revolt) and **downward** (remember)
- Resilience comes from **diversity and redundancy** across scales
